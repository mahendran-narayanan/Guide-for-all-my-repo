This is my first repo ever published in GitHub.

### [Intro to Data Science](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Intro-to-Data-Science)

Participated in Google Developers Hackathon in Coimbatore,Tamil Nadu. All persons going really fast like Bugatti Veyron for two full days. Lot of experience for me to be present at that moment.

### [Maze Game](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/MazeGame)
A Virtual Reality workshop that I ever attended to know what Virtual Reality is. Nice experience to develop some basic level gaming and play the game that i created by myself.(Wow!)

### [DSLR RAW image to Jpeg format](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Canon-CR2-to-jpeg)
This program idea started and completed in the same day. Me and my friend got the original photos shot using CANON DSLR. But we had a problem of having all the files in RAW format.So i used few python libraries to get all those pictures to Jpeg. This gives me a understanding of what python is . And how can i use it to the fullest.
To run this code download and save it in the folder where all RAW images are and then run this program. 

### [Book-Management](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Book-Management)
Started due to the fond of Django platform. And then i realized i need some more knowledge in creating something new.

### [Web Scraper](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Webscraper)
Used this to scrap the images from the web. I stopped it because of one article which said Google doesnot allow us to scrap the sites. If they found my IP will be banned. (At that time i have no knowledge of using API's)

### [Raw File Converter](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/rawfileconverter)
This is actually the continuation of [this](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Canon-CR2-to-jpeg) project. I thought of implementing that as a python package so that it will be useful to the people. Yet to complete.

### [ODI Cricket Stats](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/ODI-Cricket-Statistics-1971-2017)
First proper implementation of Kaggle kernel. Yet to discover its full potential.
