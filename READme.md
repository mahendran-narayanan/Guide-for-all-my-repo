## Guide to all my Repositories

### [Resume](https://mahendran-narayanan.github.io/)
My Resume

### [Django ML](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Django-ML)
Under Development. Trying to develop a web application which uses Machine Learning posenet model and predicts the pose realtime. Inspired from [this](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/05/real-time-human-pose-estimation-in.html) blog post.

### [Django Forms](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Django-forms)
Developed a web application which uses form. Uses MySQL as backend.

### [Django Calculator](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Django-calculator)
Calculator app combined with Django to create as a web application.

### [Wear Mask](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/wear-mask)
Developed a simple awareness site due to COVID-19. When a person views this page, the mask automatically covers the face. This site needs camera access. Developed using posenet model in tensorflow with help of ml5js (machine learning library) and p5js (JavaScript library).
This project is accepted in huge collection of useful projects and resources for COVID-19 (2019 novel Coronavirus). Repo [link](https://github.com/soroushchehresa/awesome-coronavirus)

### [Simple Neural Networks](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Daily-Nlog)
This repository contains some of the segments of code implemented in neural networks

### [Pytorch Notebooks](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Pytorch)
This repository contains some of the code which i tried to implement in pytorch

### [Tensorflow Notebooks](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/tensorflow)
This repository contains my experiments with tensorflow.

### [Exponential Weighted Average](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Exponentially-weighted-average)
This notebook helps in knowing the exponentially weighted moving average. This is implemented with the help of the course in Coursera Deep Learning Specialization.

### [GDG Hackathon](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/gdgcbe_21_Spartans_KCT)
Participated in Google Developers Hackathon in Coimbatore,Tamil Nadu. All persons going really fast like Bugatti Veyron for two full days (Yes!. I love that car). Lot of experience for me to be present at that moment.

### [Web Scraper](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Webscraper)
Used this to scrap the images from the web. I stopped it because of one article which said Google doesnot allow us to scrap the sites. If they found my IP will be banned. (At that time i have no knowledge of using API's)

### [Canon CR2 to jpeg](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Canon-CR2-to-jpeg)
This program idea started and completed in the same day. Me and my friend got the original photos shot using CANON DSLR. But we had a problem of having all the files in RAW format.So i used few python libraries to get all those pictures to Jpeg. This gives me a understanding of what python is . And how can i use it to the fullest.
To run this code download and save it in the folder where all RAW images are and then run this program. 

### [Intro to Data Science](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Intro-to-Data-Science)
This contains the answers for the course named Introduction to Data Science by Microsoft. Pretty tough to complete in initial phases of studying Data Science.


### [Maze Game](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/MazeGame)
A Virtual Reality workshop that I ever attended to know what Virtual Reality is. Nice experience to develop some basic level gaming and play the game that i created by myself.(Wow!)


### [Book-Management](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Book-Management)
Started due to the fond of Django platform. And then i realized i need some more knowledge in creating something new.


### [Raw File Converter](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/rawfileconverter)
This is actually the continuation of [this](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/Canon-CR2-to-jpeg) project. I thought of implementing that as a python package so that it will be useful to the people. Yet to complete.

### [ODI Cricket Stats](https://github.com/mahendran-narayanan/ODI-Cricket-Statistics-1971-2017)
First proper implementation of Kaggle kernel. Yet to discover its full potential.
